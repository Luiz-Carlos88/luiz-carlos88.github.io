  <strong>PhD in Electrical Engineering | AI & Computer Vision Specialist</strong>
</p>

I am a PhD in Electrical Engineering (UNESP) with over 6 years of experience in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science, working in both academic and corporate environments. I am passionate about developing and implementing end-to-end AI solutions and am proficient in Python for model development, algorithm optimization, and automation.

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on:**
    - Developing embedded software and AI cloud infrastructure on AWS (using Lambda, S3, and RDS).
    - Applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning for object detection and segmentation tasks.
    - Optimizing algorithms (Python, CUDA) for embedded hardware, such as NVIDIA Jetson modules with the DeepStream SDK.
    - Building and maintaining data pipelines and MLOps workflows using PySpark, Docker, and Git.

- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently researching and learning about:**
    - Advanced applications in **precision agriculture**, including **robotics** and automation for agricultural environments.
    - The development, fine-tuning, and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs).
    - New neural network architectures and optimization techniques for low-cost hardware, a topic from my PhD thesis.

- ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:**
    - Open-source projects involving AI and Computer Vision applied to real-world challenges, particularly in **precision agriculture** and **robotics**.

- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help with:**
    - Ideas and new applications for AI on embedded devices (Edge AI) and efficient Deep Learning models.

- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about:**
    - Python, Computer Vision (OpenCV), Deep Learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch), AWS (Lambda, S3, RDS, etc.), MLOps (PySpark, Docker, Git), NVIDIA Jetson/DeepStream, and databases like PostgreSQL.

- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:**
