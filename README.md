    - [cite_start]Developing embedded software and AI cloud infrastructure on AWS (using Lambda, S3, and RDS).
    - [cite_start]Applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning for object detection and segmentation tasks.
    - [cite_start]Optimizing algorithms (Python, CUDA) for embedded hardware, such as NVIDIA Jetson modules with the DeepStream SDK.
    - [cite_start]Building and maintaining data pipelines and MLOps workflows using PySpark, Docker, and Git.

- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently researching and learning about:**
    - [cite_start]Advanced applications in **precision agriculture** [cite: 6][cite_start], including **robotics**  and automation for agricultural environments.
    - [cite_start]The development, fine-tuning, and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs).
    - [cite_start]New neural network architectures and optimization techniques for low-cost hardware, a topic from my PhD thesis.

- ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:**
    - [cite_start]Open-source projects involving AI and Computer Vision applied to real-world challenges, particularly in **precision agriculture**  [cite_start]and **robotics**.

- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help with:**
    - Ideas and new applications for AI on embedded devices (Edge AI) and efficient Deep Learning models.

- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about:**
    - [cite_start]Python [cite: 13][cite_start], Computer Vision (OpenCV) [cite: 13][cite_start], Deep Learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch) [cite: 13][cite_start], AWS (Lambda, S3, RDS, etc.) [cite: 4][cite_start], MLOps (PySpark, Docker, Git) [cite: 14][cite_start], NVIDIA Jetson/DeepStream [cite: 12][cite_start], and databases like PostgreSQL.

- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:**
